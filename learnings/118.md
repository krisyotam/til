### Newly Discovered Mathematical Resources
Upon browsing [r/mathematics](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/) I came across this 
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/1jfhn6f/hi_looking_for_mathematics_books_that_can_be/). 

##### The Premise
The inquiry of this post was to find "books that would give a layperson introduction into a mathematical way of thought. 

There were numerous responses to this of which I have left below with a link to each message.

##### The Resources
here the numerous resources are listed with links to the original posters.
